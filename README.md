# IPL-Prediction

This is a Machine Learning algorithm for Prediction.

For Context The following functions are used
      
      -pandas
      -numpy
      -seaborn
      -matpltlib
      -sklearn
      
1. First the data is read into the algorithm for it to process.
2. Then the dataset is trained on the algorithm.
3. The trained dataset is then tested.
4. Finally the algorithm gives the predictions for the given data.
